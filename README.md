## current status

### OCamlPro company

I'm contributing to the **OCamlPro** `owi` 🐌 project ([Ocaml Webassembly Interpreter](https://github.com/OCamlPro/owi/)),
part of a research project on OCaml to Wasm compilation.

### Side project

`ola` ([Ocaml LuA experiments](https://github.com/epatrizio/ola)) is a personal experimental project.
First step, `ola` is a Lua language interpreter written in OCaml.\
The objective is to have a deeper understanding of dynamic languages.

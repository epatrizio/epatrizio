## current status

2024, sept: I'm part of the [Sismic](https://github.com/sismicfr) team, a software publisher.\
My role is to help the team improve the quality of its source code production
(agile mindset, software design, testing, etc.).

## Side projects

### miniml2wasm

`miniml2wasm` ([MiniML to WebAssembly compiler](https://github.com/epatrizio/miniml2wasm)) is a personal pedagogical project.\
This compiler, written in OCaml, has several goals : First of all, it's always difficult to write a compiler, so, let's try!\
Next, I'd like to better understand ML languages (e.g. strong static typing, inference) and manipulate Wasm bytecode.

### ola

`ola` ([Ocaml LuA interpreter](https://github.com/epatrizio/ola)) is a personal pedagogical project.\
First of all, `ola` is a Lua language interpreter written in OCaml.\
Then, `ola` is a space where I can really discover Lua.\
At the end, my objective is to obtain a deeper understanding of dynamic languages,
build on a minimal (but powerful) design!

### owi

I contributed (I remain close) to the **OCamlPro** `owi` 🐌 project
([OCaml WebAssembly toolchain : concrete and symbolic interpretation](https://github.com/OCamlPro/owi/)),
part of a research project on OCaml to Wasm compilation.

## current status

### OCamlPro company

I contribute to the **OCamlPro** `owi` 🐌 project
([OCaml WebAssembly toolchain : concrete and symbolic interpretation](https://github.com/OCamlPro/owi/)),
part of a research project on OCaml to Wasm compilation.

### Side project

`ola` ([OCaml Lua experiments](https://github.com/epatrizio/ola)) is a personal experimental project.
First step, `ola` is a Lua language interpreter written in OCaml.\
My objective is to obtain a deeper understanding of dynamic languages design.
